    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team.push('Natasha')

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    players.pop()

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const copy0 = players.slice()
    copy0.push('Fellipe')
    console.group('Using slice:')
    console.log(players)
    console.log(copy0)
    console.groupEnd('Using slice:')

    // one way
    const copy1 = Array.from(players)
    copy1.push('Camila')
    console.group('Using Array.from():')
    console.log(players)
    console.log(copy1)
    console.groupEnd('Using Array.from():')

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy2 = [].concat(players)
    copy2.push('Joaquim')
    console.group('Creating a new array and concating the old one in:')
    console.log(players)
    console.log(copy2)
    console.groupEnd('Creating a new array and concating the old one in:')

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy3 = [...players]
    copy3.push('Carlos')
    console.group('Using ES6 Spread Operator:')
    console.log(players)
    console.log(copy3)
    console.groupEnd('Using ES6 Spread Operator:')
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const developer = person
    developer.age = 25
    console.log(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const copy = Object.assign({}, person)
    copy.job = 'Developer'
    console.log(copy)
    console.log(person)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
